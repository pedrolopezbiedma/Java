***** Sudoku *****

--- Introduction. ---

This is a version of the known game Sudoku built by me.

--- Game. ---

Game starts asking the end user to enter a dificulty which means how many sqaure will be hidden at the start of the game.

From there, the end user can fill each cell with possible values and when is sure about a single one, the value can be set as fix. All these actions can be done via a text menu.

I hope you enjoy it!!!!
