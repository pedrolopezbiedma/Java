***** Napakalaki Game *****

--- Introduction. ---

Napakalaki game is based on the known game Munchkin designed by Steve Jackson. In our version of the game, several players will fight trying to obtain level 10 before the rest of the players.

To do this, eahc of them will fight against random monsters using their level + the bonus gained from treasures obtained whether initially or from defeating other monsters.

--- Treasures. ---

Each player will be able to keep 2 set of treasures: Visibles ( Equiped ) or Hidden.

These treasures will contain a type ( ONEHAND, SHOES, HELMET, BOTHANDS or ARMOR ),and a bonus. This bonus will be added to the player level if the treasure is equiped ( visible ) in order to calculate the combat level from the player whenever a combat take place.

A player can equip hidden treasures ( making them visibles ) following some rules:

- Visible treasures cannot be hidden again.
- A player can only have a maximum of 4 hidden treasures.
- Only a kind of treasure can be visible except for the ONEHAND, for those players can have 2.
- Whenever the player have a BOTHANDS or 2 ONEHAND treasure visible, he cannot equip another one from the other kind.

--- Monsters. ---

Each monster has a level combat, a Prize and a BacConsequence. Level will be checked against the player combat level:

- If player level is higher: Player wins the combat and the prize is applied to him ( gaining levels and/or random treasures ).
- If player level is not higher: Player losses the combat and the BadConsequence is applied to him ( losing levels and/or treasures and even dying. )

--- Game Development. ---

Each player will gain a random number of treasures ( between 1-3 ) at the start of the game. From that point, players will change turns equiping treasures, discovering monsters cards and fighting agaisnt them.

--- What will you find here. ---

I have two versions of the game:

- Plain Napakalaki: This is the plain version of the game where a tester interface is used to play. Players will be able to use several commands from a menu in order to perform each action needed in the game.

- Napakalaki with UI: This is the same game but I've developed a simple UI in order to make the game more attractive.

--- How to play. ---

If you want to play whether the plain version or the UI version of the game, you just need to download the folder with the code of the version tht you want.

Once you've done it, open it in any Java IDE ( like for example NetBeans ) and execute it :)

I hope you enjoy it!!!!
